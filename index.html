                <h3>Mejbani</h3>
                    <p>We recommend choosing a chuck steak. Chuck steak is perfect for your every curry need. It is a well-used cut that comes from the shoulder of the animal and, while lean, it has a high content of collagen, a good amount of marbling and low external fat.</div>

                <h3>Pizza</h3>
                    <p>If you don't have a baking stone, bake the pizza right on the baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes, then rotate the pizza. If using parchment, slide it out from under the pizza and discard. Bake until the crust is golden-brown and the cheese is melted and browned in spots, 3 to 5 minutes more.

                <h3>Steak</h3>
                    <p>Cook a 2cm-thick piece of steak for 2-3 minutes each side for rare, 4 minutes each side for medium, and 5-6 minutes each side for well-done. Turn the steak only once, otherwise it will dry out. Always use tongs to handle steak as they won't pierce the meat, allowing the juices to escape.
